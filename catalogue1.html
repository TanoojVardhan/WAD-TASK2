        <h3>Product 1</h3>
        <p>240 GSM fabric is considered to be slightly heavier than medium weight, which lends itself to increased durability and making it suitable for cooler temperatures. 100% cotton fabric is hypoallergenic and gentle against skin. Super combed cotton is known to reduce shrinkage and color fade. Pre-shrinking the fabric helps to maintain the t-shirt's size after washing. Furthermore, it is bio-washed, making it soft and comfortable without the use of any harsh chemicals. Lycra ribbed neck construction is highly durable and won't lose its shape. Unisex regular fit is designed to fit both men and women, with a straight-cut from the shoulders.</p>
        <p>Price: ₹1,499.00</p>
